=      File description     =
=============================
* HumanSpaceShip.java- This file contains a class that represent the Human controlled type spaceship.
 it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips, and overrides few of it's functions-
 doAction,getImag. This space ship is controlled by the user. The keys are: left-arrow and right-arrow to
turn, up-arrow to accelerate, ’d’ to fire a shot, ’s’ to turn on the shield, ’a’ to teleport.
 The order of precedence is: teleport,accelerate and turn, shield activated, firing a shot, regenerating energy.
 
* AggressiveSpaceShip-This file contains a class that represent the Aggressive type spaceship.
it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips,
 and overrides few of it's functions- doAction,getImag.This space ship pursues other ships and tries to fire at them.
 
* BasherSpaceShip.java- This file contains a class that represent  the Basher type spaceship.
it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips, and
 overrides few of it's functions- doAction,getImag. This space ship attempts to collide with other ship.

* RunnerSpaceShip-This file  contains a class that represent the Runner type spaceship.
 it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips,
 and overrides few of it's functions- doAction,getImag. This space ship attempts to run away from the fight.

* DrunkardSpaceShip- This file  contains a class that represent the Drunk type spaceship.
it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips,
and overrides few of it's functions- doAction,getImag. This space ship driver is drunk and there for he moves only
 in one direction (right) and fires at random location.

* SpecialSpaceShip - This file  contains a class that represent the special type spaceship.
 it inherits all the methods and data members from the abstract class SpaceShips, and overrides few of it's functions-
 doAction,getImage and fire . This space ship is has special skills- its following the closest space ship and shots it.
Its special skill is that its energy doesnt gets down after firing and it can fire without waiting for 7 rounds.
more over- the fire method fires 2 shots every time.

* SpaceShip.java-This file contains a class that represent the abstract class SpaceShip.
This class contains all the data members and actions (different methods like fire,shieldUp,gotHit etc.) that every
spaceship needs to know and do.

* SpaceShipFactory.java- This file contains a class-This class has a single method and it is used by the supplied
driver to create all the spaceships objects according to the command line arguments.

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I decided to design the game using abstract class.
I mde the SpaceShip class abstract with two abstract methods- doAction and getImage.
I chose these 2 methods to be abstract because each spaceship have different action it need to preform and its image
depends on other factors and looks different.
All the other methods and data members is regular (not abstract) because there are a lot of similarities between the
different spaceship types.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
Drank spaceship- I decided to make this type of space ship move in on direction (which causes it to rotate without a
stop) and to shot when the distance from the closest space ship is smaller than random number.
Special space ship- I decided to override the fire() method and to make the shooting accrue twice. moreover,
this space ship does not lose energy after firing and does not need to wait 7 rounds.
more over, I made the spaceship "run" after the closest space ship (similar to the basher type) and these
qualities made this spaceship pretty invincible.

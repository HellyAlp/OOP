=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I designed all the classes as described in the ex API.
I added one method in the Library class-numBooksBorrowed
this method check how many books a given patron has already borrwed in
order to confirm that patron does not borrow more books than allowd.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In the library class I've created an array for books that is register to the library and an array for the patrons
that registered to the library
In the ex we were asked to give each object (patron and book) an non negative id number, ive used the object
index in its array for that
id number.
